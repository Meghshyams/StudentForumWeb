⦁	INTRODUCTION


The simplistic definition of a forum/room is a place where people have the ability to start communication and reply to other people's threads. A member of the forum posts a message, which is visible to registered user in that forum. We can get educational information on this site. We can exchanges the information with the registered users.

As we all are aware about the Forum. The dictionary meaning of the Forum is nothing but a platform where all we can share our views easily or publically with each other. Forum/room is the place where we can give our information or knowledge to others. In this website that is The Student’s Room (Student Forum), we are using three main modules that is First module is Of Administrator, Second Module is of Expert and Third is of Student Module.

This is the website is like a social hub or social networking where we can connect with friends and we can share our view or queries with  them, here the student can submit their queries and the answer for the queries can be solved by the Experts. Student can make their queries, and they also can upload the documents and can be download the documents. Student can edit their profile and can change the photo. And by clicking on Logout button they redirect to the Home page.

Administrator plays vital role in this project because he is the only person who can manage all the stuff which is in this project. Document validation can do by the administrator only.
